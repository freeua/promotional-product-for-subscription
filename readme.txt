4. Click the Install Now button.

= Manual Plugin Installation =

In rare cases, you may need to install a plugin by manually transferring the files onto the server. This is recommended only when absolutely necessary, for example when your server is not configured to allow automatic installations.

This procedure requires you to be familiar with the process of transferring files using an SFTP client

1.	If your plugin is in the form of a zip file, unzip the contents. You should see a single folder named after the plugin.
2.	Look in the plugin folder for a readme.txt file. Read the file to confirm that this is the correct plugin, and to look for any special instructions.
3.	Connect to your WordPress server with your SFTP client.
4.	Copy the plugin folder to the wp-content/plugins folder in your WordPress directory. This installs the plugin to your WordPress site.
5.	Navigate to your Plugins admin screen and locate the newly uploaded plugin in the list.
6.	Click the plugin’s “Activate” link.
7.	If there is one, click the plugin’s “View details” link to learn more about the plugin.
